# Binary to Decimal - Bin2Dec 🧐
 
Got this idea from [App Idea](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md) 😃

If you want to take a look at the project click the link 👉 [Bin2Dec](https://snack.expo.io/@cromaaa/bin2dec)

*Binary is the number system all digital computers are based on. Therefore it's important for developers to understand binary, or base 2, mathematics. The purpose of Bin2Dec is to provide practice and understanding of how binary calculations.*

I chose to do this project because of my degree in Computer Engineering so binary numbers have always been by my side, this project was developed with React Native.
